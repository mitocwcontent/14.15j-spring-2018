*   Subgame perfect equillibrium
*   Rubinstein's bargaining game

Strategic Substitutes
---------------------

If other players act _more_ aggressively, you have incentive to act _less_ aggressively, and vice versa.

Strategic Complements
---------------------

If other players act _more_ aggressively, you have incentive to act _more_ aggressively, and vice versa.

### _Example_: Playing Sports with Friends

*   _N_ = {1, 2, 3}
*   _Si_ = ℝ+ = \[0, ∞)
*   _u__i_(_x__i_, _x__\-i_, δ, _G_) = _x__i_ — ½ _xi__2_ + δ∑(j≠i) _gij xi x__j_
    *   Where δ is the degree of complementarity (δ ≥ 0). 
*   Best response of player _i_:

*   Collectively, _BRi_(_x__\-i_) = 𝟙 + δ_G_𝕏.
*   The equilibrium (fixed point) is 𝕏\* = (_I_ — δ_G_)\-1𝟙.

Subgame Perfect Equilibrium
---------------------------

Nash equlibrium only requires mutual optimality:

*   Issue 1: In dynamic games, cannot change the strategy you have taken in the past.
    *   Subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE).
*   Issue 2: Some players may know what other players don't.
    *   (Perfect) Bayesian Nash equilibrium.

### _Example_: Battle of the Sexes

| &nbsp; | Shopping |  Football |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shopping | (3, 2) | (0, 0) |
| Football | (0, 0) | (2, 3) 

*   Where (3, 2) and (2, 3) are the two Nash equalibirums.

Suppose the girl wakes up very early. Then, she can wait at Starbucks in the mall.

Then, (3, 2) is the unique SPE. The guy claiming that he'll definitely go to football no matter what is an "empty threat."

Rubinstein's Bargaining Game
----------------------------

*   Seller (player 1) does not value the good: _v__1_ = 0.
*   Buyer (player 2) values the good: _v__2_ = 1.

_Question_: How is the price determined?  
_Answer_: Many models, e.g. take-it-or-leave-it-offer. Rubenstein's is important because it can generate price ≈ ½ without altruism.

Suppose they make alternating offers of prices until either accepts an offer. What is the SPE?

When traded at price _p_:

*   Player 1 receives payoff _p_.
*   Player 2 receives payoff _q_ := 1 — _p_.

Trick: Let ͟_p_ and _p̅_ be the minimum and maximum payoffs 1 can receive in his turn. Similarly, define ͟_q_ and _q̅_.

*   In 1's turn, since any offer above δ _q̅_ is accepted, _p_ ≥ 1 — δ_q̅_.
*   Since any offer below δ͟q is rejected, p̅ ≤ 1 — δ͟q.
*   Similarly, in 2's turn, we get ͟q ≥ 1 — δ p̅ and q̅ ≤ 1 — δ͟p.
*   Combining, we get:
    *   ͟_p_ ≥ 1 — δ_q̅_ ≥ 1 — δ(1 — δ͟_p_) ⇒ ͟_p_ ≥ (1 — δ)/(1 — δ2) = 1/(1 + δ).
    *   _p̅_ ≤ 1 — δ͟_q_ ≤ 1 — δ(1 — δ_p̅_) ⇒ _p̅_ ≤ (1 — δ)/(1 — δ2) = 1/(1 + δ).
*   Thus, ͟_p_ = _p̅_ = 1/(1 + δ) and ͟_q_ = _q̅_ = 1/(1 + δ).

Bottom line: If there is any SPE, 1's payoff at _t_\=odd should be 1/(1 + δ) and 2's payoff at _t_\=even be 1/(1 + δ).

Indeed, this equilibrium payoff profile is attainable if and only if they take the following strategies:

*   Player 1: At _t_\=odd, offer _p_ = 1(1 + δ)  
    and at _t_\=even, accept any offer above _p_ = δ/(1 + δ).
*   Player 2: At _t_\=odd, accept any offer above _q_ = δ/(1 + δ)   
    and at _t_\=even, offer _q_ = 1/(1 + δ).

On the equilibrium path, 1 offers _p_ = 1/(1 + δ) and 2 immediately accepts it; end of game.
