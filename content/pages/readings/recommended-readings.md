Two more textbooks that cover a lot of material in network economics are:

*   Jackson, Matthew. _Social and Economic Networks_. Princeton University Press, 2010. ISBN: 9780691148205.
*   Goyal, Sanjeev. _Connections: An Introduction to the Economics of Networks_. Princeton University Press, 2009. ISBN: 9780691141183.

and are useful references both for substantive and technical material.

Another great recent textbook in network science is (called unsurprisingly):

*   Barabasi, Albert-Laszlo. _Network Science_. Cambridge University Press, 2016. ISBN: 9781107076266.

If you're looking for research project ideas, this Handbook summarizes the current frontier of research in network economics:

*   Bramoulle, Yann, Andrea Galeotti, and Brian Rogers (eds.) _The Oxford Handbook of the Economics of Networks_. Oxford University Press, 2016. ISBN: 9780199948277.

The analysis of economic and social networks heavily relies on game theory. Of course, the course does not presume any game theoretic background, though some of the students will have taken [_14.12 Economic Applications of Game Theory_](/courses/14-12-economic-applications-of-game-theory-fall-2012) or may be cross-registered at the same time as this course. We will cover all of the game theory that you need as we go along. Two books that are excellent references are:

*   Osborne, Martin. _Introduction to Game Theory_. Oxford University Press, 2003. ISBN: 9780195128956.
*   Gibbons, Robert. _Game Theory for Applied Economists_. Princeton University Press, 1992. ISBN: 9780691003955.

In addition, we will refer to a variety of other books that are non-technical. These will be particularly useful in providing you with context and possible real-world applications. Here are accessible books by scientists about their research in networks:

*   Barabasi, Albert-Laszlo. _Linked: How Everything Is Linked to Everything Else and What It Means for Business, Science and Everyday Life_. Penguin Books, 2014. ISBN: 9780465085736.
*   Pentland, Alex. _Social Physics: How Social Networks Can Make Us Smarter._ Penguin Books, 2015. ISBN: 9780143126331.
*   Christakis, Nicholas and James Fowler. _Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives_. Back Bay Books, 2011. ISBN: 9780316036139.
*   Watts, Duncan. _Everything Is Obvious: How Common Sense Fails Us_. Crown Business, 2012. ISBN: 9780307951793.
*   Schelling, Thomas. _Micromotives and Macrobehavior_. WW Norton & Co., 2006. ISBN: 9780393329469.

There are also popular books about networks by excellent journalists. Some of the material in these books is overblown, so be warned.

*   Gladwell, Malcolm. _The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Dierence_. Back Bay Books, 2002. ISBN: 9780316346627.
*   Surowiecki, James. _The Wisdom of Crowds: Why the Many Are Smarter Than the Few and How Collective Wisdom Sharpens Business, Economies, Societies, and Nations_. Anchor, 2005. ISBN: 9780385721707.

Finally, we will also refer to the following books for basic background on Dynamic Systems and Markov chains:

*   Luenberger, David. _Introduction to Dynamic Systems: Theory, Models, and Applications_. Wiley, 1979. ISBN: 9780471025948.
*   Bertsekas, Dimitri and John Tsitsiklis. _Introduction to Probability_. Athena Scientic, 2008. ISBN: 9781886529236.
